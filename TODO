@TODO:
  ✔ Document `data-swup-fragment-modal`
  ❍ Tests – maybe in the plugin itself in this case?
  ✔ If possible: Warn about overlayed fragments that don't have an initial [data-swup-fragment-url]
    > kind of solved in `handleLinksToFragments`
  ✔ Use custom elements for `swup-fragment-slot` and `swup-modal-origin`
