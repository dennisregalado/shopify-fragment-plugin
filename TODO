@TODO:
  ❍ Think about the API `teleport`: maybe `modal` is more clear? DOM or JS?
  ❍ Document `teleport`
  ❍ Tests – maybe in the plugin itself in this case?
  ❍ Check if the code of `TeleportBaseElement` should be optimized
  ✔ If possible: Warn about overlayed fragments that don't have an initial [data-swup-fragment-url]
    > kind of solved in `handleLinksToFragments`
